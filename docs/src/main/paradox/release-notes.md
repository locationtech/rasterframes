## 0.9.x

### 0.9.1

* Upgraded to Spark 2.4.7

* `TileUDF`s are encoded using directly into Catalyst--without Kryo--resulting in an insane
 decrease in serialization time for small tiles (`int8`, <= 128²), and pretty awesome speedup for
 all other cell types other than `float32` (marginal slowing). While not measured, memory 
 footprint is expected to have gone down.


### 0.5.5

* `aggStats` and `tileMean` functions rewritten to compute simple statistics directly rather than using `StreamingHistogram`
